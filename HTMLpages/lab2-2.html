 <h2>Your Five Business Introduction Rules</h2>   
    
   <ol type="1">
    
    <li><strong>Stand Up:</strong> When you are seated and someone approaches you to say "hello" with a handshake, stand up, whether you are a man or woman. By doing so, you show the person you are greeting that they are worth your full attention.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Make eye contact:</strong> By looking at someone directly in the eye, you accomplish three things:</li>
    
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
    <li>You will project an image of self-confidence and a healthy self-esteem.</li>   
       <li>You will be percieved as a good listener.</li>
       <li>You will probably receive the same courtesy when you speak.</li> 
        
     
        
       </ul>
     <li><strong>Smile:</strong>It sends others a message of acceptance.</li>  
    
       <li><strong>say Your Name:</strong>If you are meeting someone for the first time you should introduce yourself using your first and last name.</li>
       
       <li><strong>Shake Hands</strong>Generally speaking, a handshake should last only as long as it takes to greet the person. It should be firm enough to display your sense of confisdence without being a bonecrusher.</li>
    
    </ol>
